To upgrade from `< 2.0.0` please follow below steps:

1. Uninstall old Plugin `homebridge-buschjaeger`
2. Install the new Plugin `homebridge-freeathome`
3. Edit homebridge's `config.json`:
    1. Change the platform to `free@home`
    2. Change the `SysIP` to the IP/Hostname of the System Access Point
    3. Set the `username` and `password` previously used for the `freeathome-api`
    4. Remove the `updateInterval` option if set
    5. Remove any unnecessary mappings. Unused accessory will automatically be detected
4. Start Homebridge

Speakers need to be readded. Just add another accessory and they should show up as *Smart Speaker*.
The `freeathome-api` can be stopped and uninstalled as it is not needed anymore.
